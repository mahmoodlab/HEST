# ST-histology-loader
hest provides a flexible approach for loading the different Spatial Transcriptomics data formats supporting H&E (Visium/Visium-HD, Xenium and ST) and for automatically aligning them with their associated histology image. Hest was used for assembling the HEST-1k dataset, processing challenging ST datasets from a wide variety of sources.
