Welcome to hest's documentation!
================================

`hest` provides a flexible approach for loading the different Spatial Transcriptomics data formats supporting H&E (Visium/Visium-HD, Xenium and ST) and for automatically aligning them with their associated histology image. `Hest` was used for assembling the `HEST-1k` dataset, processing challenging ST datasets from a wide variety of sources.
